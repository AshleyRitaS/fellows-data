However, Vigour had little interest in the life his elders envisioned for him: a life spent locked away in secluded monasteries, surrounded by books and murals, experiencing the world solely through the eyes of others. Instead, he chose a path of exploration, traveling across the lands, seeing the world with his own eyes, and creating his own stories. During his travels, he immersed himself in the study of ancient rune carvings that spoke of the fabled Light-Bringers—beings said to have woven the very fabric of creation with their radiant power.\r\n\r\nOn one of his journeys, Vigour stumbled upon an dusty tome that set him on the path toward his destiny. Within its pages lay the secrets of the Radiant Runes—describing an ancient discipline for binding light itself in order to wield it as an extension of one's will.\r\n\r\nThrough his eventual mastery of the Radiant Runes, Vigour now taps into the very essence of light with ease—a power he uses to defend those in need from the many forms of darkness that seek to corrupt the world. His sacred duty is not only to heal the wounded but also to strike down those who would use shadows to harm the innocent. It is said that the light he calls forth is both a gift of life and a harbinger of divine wrath, as those who stand in his way are met with the full force of his radiant judgment.",
